# Question-Answering Chatbot with Fine-Tuning and Sentiment Analysis Using Hugging Face Transformers

Welcome to this repository! This project explores the **Question Answering (Qu-An)** task in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using pre-trained models from **Hugging Face**. This README will guide you through the concepts, implementation, and use cases of question answering models.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Question answering is a fascinating and practical application of NLP. It involves answering questions posed by a user based on a given context or input body of text. Some key applications include:

- **Self-service systems**: Answering customer queries based on product catalogs.
- **Knowledge retrieval**: Searching encyclopedias or large text corpora for answers to user queries.

## 🔍 How Question Answering Works

### Input Components:
1. **Corpus/Context**: The body of text that serves as the knowledge base.
2. **Question**: The query posed by the user.

### Key Steps:
1. **Tokenization & Vectorization**: 
   - Both the input corpus and the user's question are tokenized and converted into numerical representations (vectors).
2. **Model Inference**:
   - The model compares the tokenized question with the context to find the most relevant segments.
   - Multiple candidate answers are scored.
3. **Answer Extraction**:
   - The model extracts the best-matching text snippet from the context.

### Tools Used:
- **Hugging Face Transformers**:
  - Provides pre-trained models and pipelines for streamlined question-answering tasks.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Easy-to-use Pre-trained Models**:
  - Quickly deploy question answering models with minimal setup.
- **Custom Context Input**:
  - Define a specific body of text to act as the knowledge base for answering questions.
- **Interactive Implementation**:
  - Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation.
