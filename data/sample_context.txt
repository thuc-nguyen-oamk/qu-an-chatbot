Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy. This energy is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules, which are created using carbon dioxide and water. The process primarily occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves the pigment chlorophyll.
